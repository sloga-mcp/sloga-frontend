# The RTC/MLS branch gate.
#
#   packages/client/scripts/rtc-gate.sh [spec-glob ...]
#
# Runs the node:test specs plus tsc, prettier --check and eslint, and judges
# each check on THE EXIT STATUS OF THAT CHECK — never on a grep of its summary
# line, and never on the exit status of something it was piped into.
#
# Why this file exists. On 2026-09-07 a gate that grepped a summary line
# reported "132/132 policy specs green" for a commit at which one spec was
# failing. Three live encrypted-call legs were then run on a build from that
# commit, and none of them was evidence about the code they were meant to
# prove. The two shapes that cause it:
#
#   node --test … | tail -20;  [ $? -eq 0 ]     # $? is tail's, always 0
#   node --test … | grep -q "fail 0"            # matches a partial summary
#
# So: run the check bare, capture its status immediately into a variable, and
# only then look at the output. `node --test` exits non-zero on any failure,
# which is the whole signal — nothing needs to be parsed.
